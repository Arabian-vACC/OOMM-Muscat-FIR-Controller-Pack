22.1 Radar services and procedures

Aircraft will be vectored and sequenced to the appropriate final approach track (ILS & VOR) so as to ensure an expeditious flow of traffic. Radar vectors and flight levels/altitudes will be issued, as required, for spacing and separating the aircraft so that correct landing intervals are maintained, taking into account various factors including aircraft characteristics.

Range 100 NM for Primary Radar

Range 256 NM for MSSR

22.2 Radio Communication failure procedure

22.2.1 At or above 6000 FT QNH

a) If in VMC, continue flight in VMC;

b) If in IMC, proceed direct to Salalah VORDME or Locator "LOM" at last assigned level and comply with ICAO procedure referenced in ENR 1.6. If unable to land, depart controlled airspace on a heading of 180 MAG, climb to 6000 FT QNH and proceed to alternate.

22.2.2 Below 6000 FT QNH:

a) If in VMC, continue flight in VMC;

b) If in IMC, make the shortest turn onto a heading of 180 MAG, climb to 6000 FT QNH, proceed to Salalah VORDME or Locator "LOM" and comply with ICAO procedure referenced in ENR 1.6. If unable to land, depart controlled airspace on a heading of 180 MAG, climb to 6000 FT QNH and proceed to alternate.

OOSA AD 2.23 ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

23.1 Bird concentration in the vicinity of the airport

Large solitary predatory birds (eagles, vultures etc.) present a hazard to air navigation at all times on the coastal plain near the vicinity of the airport. Pilots are advised to exercise extreme caution when approaching or departing, particularly below ALT 3000 FT. ATC will endeavour to keep pilots advised of bird concentrations, but single birds circling at any height are very difficult to observe by ATC. Pilot reports of bird concentrations are requested. These reports are very useful in planning a programme to attempt a reduction of bird strike hazards.



23.2 General safety measures for Visual Docking Guidance System (VDGS) operations

23.2.1 The VDGS has a built-in error detection program to inform the aircraft pilot of impending dangers during the docking procedures.

23.2.2 If the pilot is unsure of the information being shown on the VDGS display unit, pilot must immediately stop the aircraft and obtain further information for clearance.

23.2.3 The pilot shall not enter the stand area, unless the docking system first is showing vertical running arrows. The pilot must not proceed beyond the bridge, unless these arrows have been superseded by the closing rate bar.

23.2.4 The pilot shall not enter the stand area, unless the aircraft type displayed is equal to approaching aircraft.

23.2.5 When using the docking system, pilots are advised to taxi into the aircraft stand at minimum speed. The system will display “SLOW DOWN” to inform the pilot if the aircraft’s taxiing speed is too fast.

23.2.6 To avoid overshooting, pilots are advised to approach the stop position slowly and observe the closing rate information displayed. Pilots should stop the aircraft immediately when seeing the “STOP” display or when given the “STOP” sign by the aircraft marshaller.

23.2.7 The FAILED MESSAGE - The message FAILED means that docking has been interrupted and has to be resumed only by manual guidance. Do not try to resume docking without manual guidance.
