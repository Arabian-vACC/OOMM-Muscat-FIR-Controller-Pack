23.1 Introduction

23.1.1 The diversity and nature of aircraft operations in Class G airspace in the immediate vicinity of Suhar Airport has occasionally led to potential conflicts between aircraft known to ATSU and unknown aircraft operating in that area. To help address this issue and thereby enhance the safety of IFR flight operations whilst having minimal impact upon aircraft operations, a Mandatory Broadcasting zone (MBZ) was established around Suhar Airport to raise situational awareness for all operating within the surrounding airspace.

23.1.2 The replacement of the Suhar MBZ with an ATZ (Class G) allows the airspace to retain its original classification, yet also allows for enhanced situational awareness for all users. This therefore increases safety for all aircraft flying with in the ATZ while imposing minimal additional restrictions.

23.1.3 In order to ensure that all aircraft operating on the ground or within the ATZ are listening on a common frequency and following standard reporting procedures, the activation of radios on board all aircraft operating within the ATZ is compulsory at all times. All flight crews shall maintain a continuous air-ground voice communication watch and establish two-way communication on the appropriate communication channel in accordance with the reporting procedures set out in Section 6 below.

23.1.4 All aircraft operating within the Suhar ATZ shall broadcast their position, intention and altitude on the Suhar Information frequency 118.725 MHz using standard ICAO phraseology.

23.2 Definition

Aerodrome Traffic Zone (ATZ) - An airspace of defined dimensions established around an aerodrome for the protection of aerodrome traffic.

Note - Aerodrome Traffic Zone is a non-ICAO definition and used in terms of CAR 179 to describe airspace similar to a CTR (Class G).

23.4 ATS Communication Facilities

Refer OOSH AD 2.18 - ATS COMMUNICATION FACILITIES.

23.5 Rules of the Air applicable within the Suhar ATZ

23.5.1 Within the Suhar ATZ the following rules of Class G Airspace will apply:

23.5.1.1 IFR and VFR flights are permitted;

23.5.1.2 Continuous two-way VHF communication mandatory;

23.5.1.3 A speed restriction of 250 KIAS applies to IFR flights below 10 000 FT ALT;

23.5.1.4 ATC clearance is not required.

23.5.1.5 On request, and to the extent possible within the coverage area of the facilities, Muscat ACC will provide a radar-derived Flight Information Service (FIS) to IFR and VFR flights operating within Class G Airspace

23.6 Communication Procedure applicable in the Suhar ATZ.

23.6.1 The following reporting procedures shall be followed by all flights operating within the Suhar ATZ:

23.6.1.1 Before Entering the Suhar ATZ:

23.6.1.1.1 At least five minutes before entering the Suhar ATZ, an initial broadcast shall be made containing:

- The designator of the station being called (SuharInformation);

- Call sign;

- Type of aircraft;

- Position;

- Flight level or altitude;

- The intention of the flight crew.

23.6.1.2 Arrivals:

23.6.1.2.1 Report entering the Suhar ATZ and providing the aircraft’s position, altitude and estimated time of landing and the pilot-in-command’s arrival procedure intentions;

23.6.1.2.2 Report when on final approach; and,

23.6.1.2.3 Report when clear of the runway on which the aircraft has landed.

23.6.1.3 In Aerodrome Traffic Circuit:

23.6.1.3.1 When joining the aerodrome traffic circuit:

- Report aircraft call sign, position in the circuit and altitude;

- Broadcasts shall be made for changes in altitude and direction; and

- Broadcasts shall be made to other aircraft in the same airspace to announce the crew's own intentions.

23.6.1.4 Before Entering Manoeuvring Area:

23.6.1.4.1 Departing aircraft must broadcast on 118.725 MHz to inform other aircraft on the ground or in the ATZ of its location and intentions.

23.6.1.5 Departures:

23.6.1.5.1 Before moving onto the take-off surface, report aircraft call sign, runway to be used for take-off, and the pilot’s intentions after take-off.

23.6.1.5.2 If a delay is encountered, broadcast intentions and expected length of delay, then rebroadcast departure intentions prior to moving onto the take-off surface

23.6.1.5.3 After take-off, report departing from the aerodrome traffic circuit, and maintain a listening watch on 118.725 MHz until clear of the Suhar ATZ.

23.6.1.6 Transiting through the Suhar ATZ:

23.6.1.6.1 At least five minutes before entering the Suhar ATZ, broadcasting the aircraft’s call sign, position, altitude and pilot’s intentions;

23.6.1.6.2 Maintain a listening watch on 118.725 MHz and make regular broadcasts regarding position, altitude and intentions; and,

23.6.1.6.3 Report when clear of the Suhar ATZ.
