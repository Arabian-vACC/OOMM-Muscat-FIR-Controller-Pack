22.1 Special procedures for Muscat CTR

The arrival, departure and transit routes shown on AD 2.OOMS-87 are mandatory to all VFR flights unless otherwise instructed by ATC.

22.2 Radar services and procedures

Aircraft will be vectored and sequenced to the appropriate final approach track (ILS, VOR, visual) so as to ensure an expeditious flow of traffic. Radar vectors and flight levels / altitudes will be issued, as required, for spacing and separating the aircraft so that correct landing intervals are maintained, taking into account various factors including aircraft characteristics.

Radar coverage - Muscat APP operates:

RAD at Muscat International Airport - Range 100 NM

Note: Pilots should operate SSR transponder equipment as follows:

a) Operation of transponders on apron areas is not permitted, except with ATC approval.

b) Departing acft shall squawk standby until take-off clearance is received.

c) All departure traffic from OOMS (Muscat International Airport) shall switch on ADS-B before startup.

d) all landing traffic (OOMS) shall keep ADS-B switched on till block-in acft stand

22.3 Radio Communication failure procedure

22.3.1 At or above 9000 FT QNH:

a) If in VMC, continue flight in VMC;

b) If in IMC, proceed direct to Muscat DVOR/DME at last assigned level and comply with ICAO procedure referenced in ENR 1.6. If unable to land, climb in DVOR/DME holding pattern and depart controlled airspace at applicable minimum en-route level, proceed to alternate.


22.3.2 Below 9000 FT QNH:
a) If in VMC, continue flight in VMC;

b) If in IMC, climb immediately to the applicable minimum safe altitude, proceed direct to the Muscat DVOR/DME and comply with ICAO procedure referenced in ENR 1.6. If unable to land, climb in the DVOR/DME holding pattern and depart controlled airspace at applicable minimum en-route level, proceed to alternate.

c) If in IMC, when on a heading to intercept RWY 08L/ 26R extended centerline and a failure is experienced or suspected, make the shortest turn onto a heading of 020° MAG, climb to 5000 FT QNH, proceed to Muscat DVOR/DME and comply with ICAO procedure referenced in ENR 1.6. If unable to land, climb in the DVOR/DME holding pattern and depart controlled airspace at applicable minimum en-route level, proceed to alternate.

Note: Due to terrain South of RWY 08L/26R extended centerline, pilots must monitor position on DVOR/DME or LOC when on intercepting heading. Pilots must ensure that they do not proceed through the extended centreline unless positively instructed to by ATC.

22.4 Helicopter procedure

Helicopters will be directed from the VFR routes to the appropriate landing area.

OOMS AD 2.23 ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

23.1 Bird concentration in the vicinity of the airport

Large solitary predatory birds (eagles, vultures etc.) present a hazard to air navigation at all times on the coastal plain near the vicinity of the airport. Pilots are advised to exercise extreme caution when approaching or departing, particularly below 3000 FT QNH. ATC will endeavor to keep pilots advised of bird concentrations, but single birds circling at any height are very difficult to observe by ATC. Pilot reports of bird concentrations are requested. These reports are very useful in planning a programme to attempt a reduction of bird strike hazards.

23.2 General safety measures for Visual Docking Guidance System (VDGS) operations

23.2.1 The VDGS has a built-in error detection program to inform the aircraft pilot of impending dangers during the docking procedures.

23.2.2 If the pilot is unsure of the information being shown on the VDGS display unit, pilot must immediately stop the aircraft and obtain further information for clearance.

23.2.3 The pilot shall not enter the stand area, unless the docking system first is showing vertical running arrows. The pilot must not proceed beyond the bridge, unless these arrows have been superseded by the closing rate bar.

23.2.4 The pilot shall not enter the stand area, unless the aircraft type displayed is equal to approaching aircraft.

23.2.5 When using the docking system, pilots are advised to taxi into the aircraft stand at minimum speed. The system will display “SLOW DOWN” to inform the pilot if the aircraft’s taxiing speed is too fast.

23.2.6 To avoid overshooting, pilots are advised to approach the stop position slowly and observe the closing rate information displayed. Pilots should stop the aircraft immediately when seeing the “STOP” display or when given the “STOP” sign by the aircraft marshaller.

23.2.7 The FAILED MESSAGE - The message FAILED means that docking has been interrupted and has to be resumed only by manual guidance. Do not try to resume docking without manual guidance.
